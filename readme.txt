Hi,
this is breakout game.The idea itself is taken from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9qMm3JbOH0&t=2816s
so all credits to Awals Mirza. It is not perfect but it works and is simple.
Feel free to copy and use it on your own. If u have any questions u can write
me krzysztofn1993@gmail.com.

U just have to compile and run.

I will try to write Genetic algorithm to play this game so checkout my
other repos if it is there!
